# WeatherCast

## Overview

This project is a simple Weather App that allows users to check the weather conditions for a specific city. It consists of three main components: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

## HTML (index.html)

The HTML file (`index.html`) sets up the structure of the web page. It includes a form for users to enter a city name and displays weather information such as temperature, description, and additional details.

## CSS (style.css)

The CSS file (`style.css`) provides a visually appealing design for the Weather App. It defines styles for fonts, buttons, input fields, and containers, creating a user-friendly interface with responsive elements.

## JavaScript (app.js)

The JavaScript file (`app.js`) handles the logic of fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input. It updates the page dynamically with the retrieved weather information, including the city name, temperature, description, and additional details.

## Key Features

- User-friendly interface with an input field and "Get Weather" button.
- Real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
- Stylish visual elements with CSS animations.
- Error handling for invalid input and network issues.

## Deployment

To run the project locally, simply download the repository and open `index.html` in a web browser. For live deployment, consider hosting it on a web server.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements include adding geolocation-based weather retrieval and incorporating more detailed weather forecasts.
